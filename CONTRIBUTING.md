# Contributing to GoldenSwan

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## The `master` Branch is Unsafe

We will do our best to keep master in good shape, with tests passing at all times. But we will sometimes make API changes that your application might not be compatible with. We will do our best to communicate these changes and always version appropriately so you can lock into a specific version if need be.

## Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints and is formatted with `prettier`. Setup `prettier` for better development practice in your editor

## Getting in Touch
